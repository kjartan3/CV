## Kjartan Heimisson

I am an aspiring programming practitioner, I am starting my journey in developing and delivering high-quality software solutions. I have a passion for coding and problem-solving, and I love to keep up with the latest technologies and industry trends. 

I started out in graphic design, before making the decision to change careers. In my previous roles, I have worked on various projects that require a range of teams from user research, design, front-end and back-end development, while I was mostly in charge of design, I became familiar with the other process of the project and began to find my passion towards software development. 

I am a team player, and I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver projects on time and within budget. Technology is constantly evolving, and new technologies are developed every day, providing endless opportunities for innovation and creativity. As someone who loves to create new things and push the current bounderies of the industry, tech really excites me.

## Skills

As a graphic designer transitioning into software engineering, my expertise in design principles, visual aesthetics, and user experience can help me create software that is not only functional but also visually appealing and intuitive to use. Additionally, my ability to work with Adobe Creative Suite and other design tools can aid me in developing and designing software interfaces. My experience with creative problem-solving and critical thinking can also assist in tackling software development challenges. With a strong foundation in design and a passion for learning new skills, I have the potential to become a valuable asset in the software development industry.

#### Development

I achieved experience in building websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A noteable example was when I redesigned a website for a sustainability firm. I went through the whole redesign process from the research/analysis to content/design to coding development and finally testing. However, this process can often have many revision rounds, and this similarly can happen in software development. I can leverage this knowledge to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces for your software.

#### Problem Solving

I contributed towards my problem solving skills whenever I had a job to rebrand. Rebranding and redesigning always requires the lengthy process of revision rounds to really hone in on the desired outcome. I would research the companies competitors as well as the target audience to ensure that something like a logo redesign would stand out and resonate. I would continuously problem-solve to balance the competing demands of creativity, functionality, and communication to ultimately create design that successfully represents the company and helps it achieve its goals.

## Hobbies

One of my noteable hobbies is training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, which I have been doing since 2018. My commitment to the martial art demonstrates physical fitness, discipline, and perseverance. BJJ is a martial art that emphasises technique and leverage over brute strength, and requires dedication and consistent practice to improve. BJJ has really taught me the ability to set and achieve goals, as well as my ability to work towards gradual improvement and mastery over time. Additionally, I have demonstrated my ability to handle stress and pressure, in addition to occassionally helping and coaching beginners.
